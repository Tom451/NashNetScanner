## Supervisor 
Nathan Clarke 

## Idea Behind this project 
The idea would be that I am able to create a system that will overall make the users life more secure. This will be done by using an intuative interface. This will be in comparison to the current systems which on average show the user an abnormal amount of information requireing a higher level of knowledge to understand it. 

# About this project 
My project will be aimed at helping the home user enhance their security within their 
home network and everyday life. 

The passion from this project comes about as being the family member in charge of looking after all things technical
I feel that currently all security related applications make it too complicated for end users to understand: 

a) Where they are going wrong.
b) What they need to do to improve it. 

# Technology used for this project. 
## IDEs and Planning
I will be using Visual Studio and PHPStorm for the programming on this project, along side this I will be using 
Microsoft planner for my organsiation this will help me to keep a track on my current jobs, the jobs that need doing, 
and any other tasks I feel appropriate.

## Languages

## How to run the program? 
There is two parts, one is the web interface which is accessed by a browser hosted externally, the second is a windows based agent that allows for scanning.
