# About this project 
My project will be aimed at helping the home user enhance their security within their 
home network and everyday life. 

The passion from this project comes about as being the family member in charge of looking after all things technical
I feel that currently all security related applications make it too complicated for end users to understand: 

a) Where they are going wrong. 
b) What they need to do to improve it.

Microsoft planner for my organsiation this will help me to keep a track on my current jobs, the jobs that need doing, 
and any other tasks I feel appropriate.
